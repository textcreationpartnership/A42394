            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Joy of Beatitude was an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Fruition of Celeſtial Delights and Comforts, without any mixture of what might interrupt it, or be diſpleaſing: And yet the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> would ſuffer his innocent Soul to be overwhelmed with inexpreſſible Griefs, and to deſcend by our Steps to the Anguiſhes of Death, to raiſe us to the greateſt Joys of Life.</p>
               <p>There was alſo a great Duel between the affectionate Love, and the Virginal Fleſh of Chriſt: His Soul did naturally love a Body, which was ſo

<note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.6.</note> Iniquities of us all; and as we were oblig'd to be ſorry for our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sins, ſo was he to be grieved for the Sins of us all. If then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32002:34"/>the Perfection of his Knowledge, he underſtood all the Sins for which he ſuffered, all the Evil and the Guilt, all the Offence againſt the Majeſty, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude againſt the Goodneſs of God, which was contain'd in the Sins of all Men, paſt, preſent, and to come. If we look upon his abſolute Conformity to the determined Will of God; he was inflam'd with moſt ardent Love; he was moſt zealous of his Glory, and moſt ſtudious to preſerve that Right which was ſo highly violated by thoſe Sins. If we look upon his Relation to the Sons of Men, he lov'd 'em all far more than they did themſelves; he knew their Sins were of themſelves ſufficient to bring Deſtruction upon their Bodies and Souls, and at the ſame time conſider'd them he ſo dearly loved, as lying under God's Wrath, whom he ſo truly worſhipped; and all was heightned with the great habitual Deteſtation wherewith his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Nature abhorred Sin. If we conſider all theſe Circumſtances, we cannot wonder at his exceſſive Sorrow: For if the true Contrition of one ſingle Sinner, bleeding under the Sting of the Law, only for his own Iniquities, (all which notwithſtanding he knoweth not) cannot be performed without great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32002:34"/>of Remorſe; what Bounds can we ſet to that Grief, what Meaſures to that Anguiſh, which proceeds from a full Apprehenſion of all the Tranſgreſſions of ſo many Millions of Sinners?</p>
               <p>Add unto all theſe Apprehenſions the immediate hand of God, preſſing upon him all this Load, laying on his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at once a heap of all the Sorrows which can happen to any of the Saints; that he being touch'd with the

               <p>Thus as often as the Spirit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the Fleſh, it ſignifies the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God and his working in us to Will and to Do of his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and the Fleſh ſignifies humane nature with all its motions, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of the Spirit. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is therefore willing becauſe it affects what belongs to it, and moves us to all good things: but the Fleſh is Weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is often Rebellious, and not in Subſerviency to the Spirit, according to

               </head>
               <p>THE Diſciples terrified with the Inſolence of the Multitude, who were now practiſing all things that might ſignifie their Contempt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Rage towards their ſilent Captive,
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.56.</note> forſook him, and fled, but with trembling Hearts, and pierc'd through with a thouſand Darts of Grief. For their Condition muſt needs be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and this a lamentable Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when having left all for him, they muſt leave him too, whom they loved better than their own Parents, and that in the hands of his cruel Enemies. The time paſt caus'd 'em to remember all the Gracious Words they had heard, all the mighty Works they had ſeen; the preſent, with the greateſt Affliction that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32002:57"/>might be repreſented, to their Fancies, all the Bleſſings they were to loſe; and that which was to come, could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to 'em but a bottomleſs Pit of Terrour and Affrightment. They apprehended, both for themſelves and their Maſter, as many Dangers as there are Thorns in the Woods; could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to themſelves nothing but endleſs Miſeries, Days without Comfort, and Nights full of Horrour; in the deep Senſe of which they pour'd out their Tears, frequently intermingling the moſt dolorous Sighs, having no other Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence but that of their hearts.</p>
               <p>On the other hand the compaſſionate <hi>Jeſus</hi> was much more troubled to be parted from thoſe whom he had choſen from among all Men, and carried about with him, as it were in his Boſom; for the Prophet <hi>Iſaia,</hi> ſpeaking in his Perſon,

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32002:58"/>by complaining to whom, we may eaſe our Hearts, and they alleviate the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Calamity, by ſeeming to ſhare it among themſelves.</p>
               <p>In thoſe deplorable Circumſtances they hurry him away towards the City with loud Clamours, much irriſion, many affronts and great haſt, till they came to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> where was the houſe of

                     <hi>John</hi> 11.49.</note> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion openly in full Councel concerning the Miracles and Perſon of Chriſt, that by profeſſing himſelf to be the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> he would doubtleſs attempt to make himſelf a King, and by the admiration he had gotten among the People might ſoon be aſſiſted to it, if not timely prevented; the Conſequence of which would be, that the <hi>Romans</hi> to whom they were Subject, would look upon it as a defection from their Government, and thence take occaſion to come with an Army, and deſtroy the Holy City and Temple of God. That therefore they were no longer to conſult at large
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32002:58"/>in what way of Juſtice to proceed with this Man, but to conſider their intereſt in point of Policy, and that they might do any thing, thô otherwiſe never ſo unlawful, to keep the Publick from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; concluding it was

                  <hi>expedient and much better, that one man ſhould be ſacrific'd for the Sins of the People, then that the whole Nation ſhould periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here the wonderful Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of Eternal Wiſdom to bring to paſs its mighty deſigns, and how we truly accompliſh the Divine Will while we ſeem never ſo irregularly to thwart it, and do our own. It was the Voice of a Man, but really an Oracle of God, as the Evangeliſt obſerves,
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 11.51.</note> He ſpake not of himſelf: but being High Prieſt that Year, he Propheſied that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould die for that Nation: and not for that Nation only, but that he ſhould gather together in one the Children of God, that were ſcattered abroad. And what more contrary to his Intention than this effect? He was meditating upon Injuſtice, and makes way for Mercy; he intended Cruelty, and opens the door of hope. What more Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then to preſecute Chriſt to Death? And what more Beneficial then that Chriſt ſhould die?</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:32002:59"/>
               <p>Thus the Holy Jeſus was already condemned in the intention of his Judge, and of the people, prejudiced with a dreadful Suſpicion, that through him they ſhould fall into an irrevocable Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; inſomuch, that forgetful of his gracious Doctrine, glorious Miracles, and ſpotleſs Innocency, they want only a colour for his utter Deſtruction. And becauſe the Inſtigator of all this the Devil, tho' he be the very Father of lyes, could object nothing againſt his God-like Life; they are forced to raiſe all their malicious Queſtions about his
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 18.19.</note> Diſciples, and his Doctrine. About his Diſciples, as where they were, why he had choſen 'em, and to what end he deſigned 'em? Suppoſing by this to have gain'd an opportunity of inditing him for Sedition and Alteration of the Government: About his Doctrine, as what it was, whence he had it, and whether it were agreeable to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets? Hoping from thence to accuſe him of Hereſy, and of Seducing and perverting the People.</p>
               <p>But our Patient Maſter would anſwer nothing as to his Diſciples, at a time when he could ſay ſo little good of 'em; for one had Betrayed him, another wounded the High-Prieſt's Servant and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32002:59"/>incens'd the multitude by his Raſhneſs, all the reſt had forſaken him and fled: nor would he reveal theſe evils of 'em, to teach us to conceal the infirmities of our Brethren. But as to his Doctrine, leaſt he ſhould be thought to repent of it, and receed from the Goſpel he came to Propagate, he confirms it, teaching us never to deny it, <hi>(having before laid an

I appeal not to my Diſciples, who might be thought Partial, but to all theſe my Enemies ſtanding by, who have heard me in the Temple, in the Synagogues, in the Ships, in the Mountains, in the Fields, every where publickly, and in great numbers.

               <p>ONE of the greateſt Tragedies in the life of Man, which makes the Curious to Queſtion, the Wiſe to Wonder, the Good to Groan, and the Wicked to Rejoyce; is to ſee a Magiſtrate willfully pervert judgment, and the Innocent oppreſt under colour of Juſtice.

When the Iniquity is come to ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as to produce Deſpair, and an intolerable Condition, then he ſuffers the Conſcience to thaw and grow ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that filling the Soul with a raging Sorrow, he may ſecure it againſt all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat by ſome Act which may render the Pardon impoſſible. The Conſcience of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32002:74"/>the Betrayer now awakned with the Horrour of the Fact, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before his Eyes, began to rouſe and follow cloſe, and the Man was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear up under the furious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges of his own Mind, as it happens in all willful and deliberate Sins, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of Blood, which is wont more ſenſibly to allarm the natural Notions of the Mind, and to excite in us the Fears of preſent Judgment.</p>
               <p>Did ever any harden himſelf againſt God, and proſper? And indeed how ſhould he, when he carries about with him ſuch a powerful Executioner in his own Boſom? In the Moment he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts the Dictates of his Conſcience, he bids Adieu to all true Quiet, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf to the ſevere Reſentments of a ſelf-torturing Mind; a Torment infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond what the moſt ingenious Tyrants ever could contrive. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo effectually invades our Eaſe, as the Reproaches of our own Mind, from which it is impoſſible we ſhou'd lye hid. The Wrath of Man may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd; but the Irruptions of Conſcience are irreſiſtible, and oft reduce a Man to ſuch Diſtreſſes, as make him chuſe Death rather than Life.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:32002:75"/>
               <p>But his Maſters, incurious of thoſe Helliſh Torments which <hi>Judas</hi> felt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (becauſe their own were not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun) and unable to contradict him, as to the quality of the Purchaſe, which they could not really deny to be Guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; diſmiſt him ſcornfully,

                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.4.</note> ſaying, <hi>What is that to us? See thou to that.</hi> If his Blood be innocent, the greater is thy Sin. We employ'd thee ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and have been punctual in our Agreement, and are out of the Reach of the Law.</p>
               <p>We ſee by this the miſerable Eſtate of all thoſe, who commit Wickedneſs for the Favour of others. They are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently derided, hated, and forſaken, by thoſe very Perſons, in whoſe Cauſe they committed it: And like to 'em are all they, who frame their Fortune upon Vice; they build on Abyſſes or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Sand; they ſow Wind, and reap Tempeſts; their Hopes are but Clouds ſwell'd with Vapours, which burſt, conſume, and come to nothing. Never had any Man good Fortune in Impiety, whatever Advantage he might at firſt propoſe. It is the Spiders Web, and an Act of Violence: He ſhall not cover himſelf with his Work, nor ſhall it ſave him from Deſtruction. He has
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32002:75"/>loſt his Conſcience, and has nothing to gain; for nothing remaineth for him but Unhappineſs: Or rather, did he gain the whole World, yet would he be the greateſt Loſer, becauſe he has loſt his own Soul.</p>
               <p>And now the Apoſtate, reduced to theſe Streights, terrified in his mind, inſtigated by the Devil, and finding no Conſolation, but amazing Reproofs, from thoſe very Perſons he had ſerv'd againſt his Conſcience; all he could hope for, was, to find ſome ſhelter, where he might hide his guilty Head.</p>
               <p>But ah! miſerable Man, what Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can cover him, who has a thouſand Torches in his own Breaſt to lay open the Guilt of his Crime: Who flies out of the Preſence of his God, ſince every place is Hell, where God is not? The moſt Peopled Cities are ſolitary Deſarts, if the God of Comfort be not there; and the moſt dreadful Solitudes and leaſt inhabited Grots become Courts and Palaces by the Reſidence of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. All Repoſes are Diſquiet; all Peace is but War; all Honours are Contempt, Parents are traiterous, Brothers envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Friends Deceivers, Beds of Down no better than Sepulchres; and Life is but a Death, or at beſt but a long and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32002:76"/>dolorous Sickneſs, unleſs God be the Loadſtone of our Hearts, the Center of our Affections, and the Height of our Glory.</p>
               <p>It is a horrible thing to ſee a Soul left to it ſelf, after it has forſaken the Inſpirations of God. It becomes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Vineyard without Encloſure: The wild Boar enters it, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and ravenous Beaſts do there ſport and leap without Controll. God hangs Clouds over it, but lets no Dew fall upon it: The Sun never looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it with a loving Eye; but all there is Barren, Venomous, and near to Hell; Blackneſs of Darkneſs, and eternal Night; Melancholy, rack'd by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; Guilt ſcourg'd by Shame; Rage tortur'd with Envy; and Vexation ſtabb'd by Regret and a tempeſtuous Repentance.</p>
               <p>And if this be the Unhappineſs of the preſent time, O! how great will be the Solitude of ſuch a Soul in her Separation? When in an Inſtant ſhe ſhall ſee nothing but all the Evils ſhe has done, and all the Wickedneſſes of her Life, ſpread before her Eyes, as ſo many Firey Serpents; for which ſhe muſt anſwer before the dreadful Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,

               <p>Let it ſuffice, O ye Jews, for this Man's Puniſhment, that he is thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably and opprobriouſly afflicted: All which has been done to him, more out of Neceſſity, than for any Offence made out againſt him; ſince after all our deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with him, I muſt confeſs him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and that I have found no fault in him.</p>
               <p>Behold the Man, whether he be now like a Man, and much leſs a King, for which you have ſo violently accus'd him. Behold his Robe, is it not of Mockery? Behold his Scepter, is it not a Reed? Behold his Face, is there any thing there which may induce the People to run after him and admire him. Behold the Man in every part, and you will find him ſo much leſs than a Man, by how much he has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd all theſe Indignities and an irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32002:99"/>Diſgrace among Men; That truly he is now the Object of our Pity, and Humanity requires us to ſympathize with his Miſeries, which are but ſo many Inſtances of our own Mutability, and ſilent Appeals to Mercy. Let it ſuffice therefore, and let us diſmiſs him. If you have envy'd him the Title of a King, you ſee it has ſufficiently deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him, and brought him to ſhame, to a ludibrious Veſture, a Crown of Thorns, painful Stripes, odious Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the Contempt of the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>But, alas! there are ſome implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirits in the World, which ſeem to partake of the Nature of Devils, and cannot be overcome either by Mildneſs or Force, but grow more obſtinate, when excited to Pity. When the Chief Prieſts and Officers ſaw Jeſus in this Condition, thoſe very Motives which melted <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſerv'd only as Incentives to their farther Rage. Invidious Malice is a poyſoned Gall, the Root of Vices, the Father of Murders, and the Mother of Death.

               <p>Hear therefore the Anſwer of the Holy Jeſus, you who hold the Ballance of Juſtice in your hands, and with whom God has intruſted the moſt dreadful of all his Attributes: For in teaching you whence you have it, he teaches you how to adminiſter it.

               <p>Having caſt him on the Wood with great Immanity, with the ſame Violence they ſnatch his Left hand, and nail it; forcing the Fleſh together into the Tree.

               <p>NO ſooner had the Benign <hi>Jeſus</hi> interceeded for his Enemies, but the Divine Goodneſs ſo ordered, that one of the Malefactors who ſuffer'd with him ſhould immediatly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and receive the Fruits of it, for the comfort of all thoſe who ſhould afterwards repent, and believe in the meritorious efficacy of his Death: Whilſt the other Thief deſperate and impatient periſht in his impenitency and unbelief, bearing the Figure of all hardned Sinners, who tho' they have <hi>Chriſt</hi> never ſo near, are ever repining, and murmuring under the Croſs, and miſtruſting the providence of God, till they are Deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:32002:134"/>poſſeſt with a deep ſenſe of all the guilt of his offences, a piercing dread of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment, and eſpecially with admiration of the Holy <hi>Jeſus, rebuk'd him, anſwering, doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? and we indeed juſtly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this Man has done nothing amiſs.

<note n="r" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>O the wonderful and unſearchable Judgments of God, who is able to convert the moſt wicked in a Moment, and would not have us raſhly condemn any, or ever deſpair of his ſaving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! Behold here a Prodigy which has nothing common in Nature, a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Revelation in the heart of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whoſe lightning is like a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt, Quick and Piercing, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away along with it whatſoever ſtood before it.</p>
               <p>The Poor Thief confeſſes <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when all his Diſciples doubted and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him. And when he had only his Heart and Tongue free, yet offers both, believing in his Heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing with his Mouth, that he was the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:32002:134"/>Lord of Glory. Which Miraculous Converſion, <hi>Jeſus</hi> entertained with a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy promiſe of a very great Felicity, that upon that very Day he ſhould be with him in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>I know not in this Action, whether I ſhould rather admire the good fortune of the Penitent Thief, or the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Power of the word Incarnate; of the Thief, who is drawn for a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat to Priſon, from Priſon to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from Sentence to the Croſs, and thence goes to Paradiſe without need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other gate but only the Heart of the Bountiful <hi>Jeſus:</hi> For, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide what can be more admirable to our thoughts, then to ſee a Crucified Man do an Act which belongs to the living God when the World ſhall end, to ſave ſome and reprobate others, and to judge from the Croſs, as if he ſate upon a Throne.</p>
               <p>As if he had ſaid, My only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and Patient Partaker in my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Griefs, thou askeſt of me with a great Faith but a ſmall thing in appearance, that I ſhould remember thee, when I come into my Kingdom. But I am not ignorant what becomes me to give, or thee to recieve for ſuch a faithful acknowledgement. Nor will
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:32002:135"/>I reward ſo great a Virtue ſhining through all the Clouds of thy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but with the Chief and greateſt Good.</p>
               <p>I am now forgotten, as a dead Man out of Mind, and mine acquaintance are hid out of my ſight: My Friends are become my Enemies, and my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples fled. <hi>Peter</hi> afraid of a Womans voice has deny'd me, and forſworn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and <hi>Judas</hi> for a little unprofitable lucre has ſold, and betray'd me; the reſt as Sheep without a Shepherd are ſcatter'd, and almoſt deſtitute of all Hope and Faith. But thou who art a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and fierce by Nature, without any advantage of Religious Education, art come hither to me out of the covert of the Woods, and the hollow Caverns of the Mountains, and meeteſt me in Love and the participation of my Croſs, more Faithful then my Friends, more Conſtant then my Diſciples, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt, and Hopeſt, and Adoreſt my Abaſement, and Contemplateſt me, Triumphing over the Powers of Death and Hell in a Servile Ignominious Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion; Confoundeſt the Ingrateful, Reprehendeſt the Blaſphemous, Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Teſtimony to my Innocency, and Fighteſt for me, all thou canſt with thy
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:32002:135"/>Tongue. Thou ſeeſt me here as a Malefactor, and yet acknowledgeſt me to be thy Holy Redeemer. Thou ſeeſt no other title or ſign of my Kingdom, but only my Body covered over with Blood and oppreſt with Dolours, and yet thou calleſt upon me as reigning in Heaven. Thou ſeeſt me in Miſery as an Abject Perſon, and confeſſeſt the infinite Glory of my Heavenly Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Fleſh and Blood has not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven, nor have I found ſo great Faith, no not in <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelf.</p>

For tho' the Ax be laid to thy Root, and thou wert ready to be caſt into the Fire; Yet art thou in time, the door of Mercy is ſtill open, yea the Fountain of Grace flows more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then ever.

And thou ſhalt reap more pleaſure, for having been partaker of theſe my Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then thou couldſt have done out of the ſpoils of Provinces, or by having been Monarch of the Univerſe. For what would it have profited thee to have gain'd the whole World, and to have loſt thy poor Soul; or to have heap'd up all the Treaſures of the Earth, if they muſt have been follow'd with Everlaſting Sorrows.</p>
               <p>Verily I ſay unto thee, and be thou ſecure of it, even this day will I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt thee before all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and thou ſhalt be where I am, becauſe thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

Thy petition was but ſmall, as thou imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt (for what is eaſier than to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) but truly the greateſt, and ſuch as ought to be the Prayer, and conſtant deſire of every Faithful expectant. For whom I forget they are cut of from my Hand, are caſt out of the light of my countenance, and reſerv'd for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under chains of Darkneſs; But whom I remember, to them I am merciful; whom I remember to be Merciful to, in my Kingdom, they are Eternally Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Preſence of my Father.</p>
               <p>Verily therefore I ſay unto thee, that in remembring I will remember thee, and with the Righreous thou ſhalt be had in Everlaſting Remembrance.

               <p>Yea thou ſhalt be the Example and Mirrour of my Mercy, wherein every Penitent may ſee his own condition, and know that my Bounty is greater then his Sin (if he will truly turn to me, that I may receive him) and that while there is Life, ſtill there is hope of acceptance upon a ſincere and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty repentance, and a ſtedfaſt Faith.

               <p>NOW while <hi>Jeſus</hi> was receiving the Penitent Thief, <hi>there
<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>John.</hi> 19.25.</note> ſtood by his Croſs the Holy Virgin Mother,</hi> Sad, and Silent, with a modeſt Grief, deep as the Waters of the Abyſs, but ſmooth and full of Love and Patience; and by her ſide his Mothers Siſter, <hi>Mary</hi> the Wife of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the Diſciple whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jeſus</hi> therefore ſaw his Mother, and the Diſciple by whom he loved; then it was we may imagine burſt forth thoſe
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.</note> Tears which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have been ſhed upon the Croſs, accompanying that Tender and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking ſight, when he began firſt to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:32002:138"/>behold her with his dying Eyes. He would not acknowledge her of whoſe Sorrows he was moſt ſenſible, leaſt he might ſeem to have reſpected Perſons or Affections: But having before Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Malicious Crucifiers, and then Comforted the Penitent Thief (as a token that all theſe bitter Sufferings were to intercede for, and ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) He now turns to his Mother in that manner, the apprehenſion whereof muſt needs affect the moſt inſenſible Heart.</p>
               <p>The preſence of Friends is indeed a refreſhment to the miſerable, while there is any comfort to be expected from them; and two are better than one, becauſe they have advantage from their Society; for if they fall, one will lift up his fellow: But here there was no ſuch conveniency in the meeting, which was moſt deplorable to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtanding by, who could lend no aſſiſtance to her tortur'd Son, and to the Crucified Son, who by his inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant pains could only augment the grief of his Mother.</p>
               <p>We read when he was a Child and miſſing but three days, <hi>She ſought him ſorrowing among her kinsfolks and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 2.48.</note> her Love, Admiration, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:32002:138"/>Meditation perpetually attending this mavellous Birth. But now ſhe may no longer find him among his Friends, for they had all forſaken him and fled, and left him environed with whole Troops of Enemies except thoſe few which accompanied her there, incited to it by her magnanimous conſtancy to be preſent at the Crucifixion of her dear Son.</p>
               <p>For ſhe had ſaid in her heart (where ſhe ever
<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 2.19.</note> treaſur'd whatſoever was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied concerning his Perſon) I will wait, and expect the Death of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. I will follow him out of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> tho' with the ſaddeſt thoughts; and I will behold with weeping Eyes, whither they bring him, how they ſtrip him, how they bore his Hands and Feet, how they nail him to the wood, and how they lift him upon the Croſs; and when all this is done, and they ſhall recede from him, and ſtand afar off, and look upon him as accurſed, then will I draw near and ſtand by the Croſs of my <hi>Jeſus;</hi> then will I embrace the wood with my Arms and waſh it with my Tears, and kiſs it with my Lips; and thô I may not die with him, yet will I fix my Eyes upon him, to engrave his wounds deep in my Heart. I will
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:32002:139"/>not now deſert him dying, who paſt by all other creatures and Children of Men, to come to me the loweſt of his Servants, and receive from me an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being; But I will ſee how he goes out of this World, who alone know how he came into it; and in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableſt kind of Fellowſhip will ſuffer inviſibly in my Heart, whatſoever he ſuffers viſibly in his Body. And thus was fulfill'd that
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 2.35.</note> Prophecy of old <hi>Simeon</hi> which he ſpake at her Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That a Sword alſo ſhould pierce her very Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then we may imagine the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt conflict between the Soul of the Bleſſed Virgin, and the Eyes of the Beloved <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which at the ſame time they were haſtning unto Death, were call'd back to look upon his Mother burning in an unutterable Flame of Love. O how deep muſt the rays of that Viſion penetrate, not only her Heart but her very Soul, wherewith the Lord vouchſaft to behold her, dying? And how oppreſt with Sighs, and overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Grief, and drowned in Tears, did ſhe lift up her Eyes to behold his disfigur'd, torn Body with the Blood diſtilling from the four great Wounds;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:32002:139"/>to behold him dying, and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, when ſhe was ready to die her ſelf? There could nothing be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him in this view but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of the Soul of his dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor could ſhe do any thing but by moſt paſſionate reflections imprint in her heart all the Torments which he ſuffer'd.</p>
               <p>At laſt after this moſt paſſionate and doleful interview, wherein the rays of their afflicted Spirits transfixt and wounded each others Soul, even to the agonies of Death; he (to teach us the tender reſpect and faithful care due to our temporal Parents) having nothing now left free but his Tongue, directs it to her, to ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her with the moſt proper Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Proviſion, which the time and circumſtances of his paſſion would permit, ſaying,
<note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>For thô he had uſually call'd her by this

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:32002:140"/>Grief and ſurrounded with Enemies: Leſt by any kinder ſort of expreſſion he might add to her exceſſive ſorrows, or by his owning her for his Mother, by calling her ſo, the Barbarous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude might be enraged againſt her. but this general term ſecured her from that danger, whilſt at the ſame time it raiſed her attention to what he ſpake for her conſolation with reſpect to his beloved Diſciple who ſtood near.</p>
               <p>As if he had ſaid, I know, O Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the inexpreſſible anxiety of thy tortur'd mind, the tender Love, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and Sorrow thou muſt needs have for an only beloved Son, dying the moſt ignominious and painful Death. I know alſo thou ſtandeſt here wiſhing by thy preſence to revive me, to die with me, or to die for me; and all theſe things I kindly accept. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, they do not more eaſe me then they wound me, unleſs I might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd whole to thy breaſt which is ſo ſorrowfully afflicted for me; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that all remedies are vain, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs ſeeing in the bitterneſs of thy Soul, pierced through with ſo many ſorrows, thou expreſſeſt to me the tenderneſs of the moſt compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:32002:140"/>Mother, thou art not to be left without conſolation, and the laſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes my circumſtances will permit.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt in what Torments I hang here, with what difficulties I am ſtraitned, in what agonies I decay, at what a price and loſs I redeem Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with what Love and Charity I embrace Mankind. It remains only now I ſhould likewiſe ſupport thee, who haſt done to me the beſt offices of an earthy Parent, and from whoſe Love none of theſe Ignominies have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me. Fear not therefore to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted after my Death, or to want a repreſentative of my Filial care: There is <hi>John</hi> thy Kinſman and otherwiſe moſt dear to us, he ſhall become thy Son in my ſtead, to obſerve and honour thee all the days of thy life. To whom I will now ſpeak in thy preſence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him in my place thy Servant and Guardian. Then turning to that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple, he ſaid,

               <p>This is that which gives Glory to the Empire of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and whereby we perceive its Divine Power and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous extent of its Conqueſts, whoſe eſtabliſhments have been ſo contrary to all humane ways.
